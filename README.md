Wave Portal

Each time a visitor connects his Metamask wallet and waves at me through the website, it is saved as a transaction on an Ethereum testnet.

Built my first blockchain project where I created a frontend interface using ReactJS, connected it to Metamask, and deployed a customer's message to me onto the the Ethereum Goerli Testnet through a Solidity smart contract. Utilized Ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
